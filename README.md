# coding-events
A webapp to store and organize coding events by name, contact emails, and tags related to the event and what kind of event is being hosted.

# Current State
Currently the application can store event names, contact emails, tags, and categories as well as display details of specific events. New tags and new categories can be added as well.

# Future improvements
Add a Person class to store attendees. Possibly could extend AbstractEntity and could intergrate Tags and a many-to-many relationship so that the application caters to interests of a particular person.
